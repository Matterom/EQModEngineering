# EQModEngineering

Original goal was to create a system to dynamically adjust the power of ships by way of the equipment mod system.
Running GenerateMods.ps1 will generate a massive set of pre defined XML diffs to be applied and configured by unfinished ingame logic, Admittedly i never found a good method for cataloging the base game EQ mods for replacement
